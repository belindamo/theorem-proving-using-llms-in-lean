# Research Concept & Direction

Research Problem & Objectives:
Advancing automated theorem proving through LLM integration with Lean proof assistant. Primary question: How can large language models enhance mathematical theorem proving efficiency and accessibility?

Knowledge Gap:
Limited integration of modern LLMs with formal theorem proving systems, particularly in Lean ecosystem.

Research Goals:
Develop LLM-Lean integration frameworks
Create automated theorem proving assistance tools
Establish MathLib-compatible workflows
Advance accessibility of formal mathematics

Scope: Lean theorem proving with MathLib setup and README specifications
Expected Contributions: LLM-assisted theorem proving tools, formal mathematics accessibility improvements
